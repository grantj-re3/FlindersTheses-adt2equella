ALMA CONFIGURATION

Equella OAI-PMH delivers 2 types of subject metadata.
 1/ <dc:subject>Barbeque</dc:subject> which maps to MARC 653$a.
 2/ <dc:subject>Subject discipline:Cooking</dc:subject> which also maps
    to MARC 653$a, but the "Subject discipline:" prefix tells Alma that
    we want it to map to 695$a. We can achieve this mapping with the
    following Alma normalization rule.


    rule "Copy 653 to 695 if 653.a starts-with 'Subject discipline:'; Remove 'Subject discipline:'"
      when
        (TRUE)
      then
        changeField "653" to "695" if (exists "653.a.Subject discipline:*")
        replaceContents "695.a.Subject discipline:" with ""
    end
