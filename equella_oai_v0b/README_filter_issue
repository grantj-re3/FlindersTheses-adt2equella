THE PROBLEM

We were planning to harvest from Equella OAI-PMH as follows:
 1/ create Equella XML for all records (ie. "unapproved"; "approved but
    embargoed/never to release"; "approved and public")
 2/ use Equella OAI-PMH XSLT to filter (and transform) the metadata to
    only harvest "approved and public" records
 3/ harvest into Alma via OAI-PMH


In the XSLT script, step 2 was achieved with:

  <xsl:template match="/xml/item/curriculum/thesis/release">
    ...
    <xsl:when test="$is_live and $will_be_open_access and $s_is_valid_release_date='true' and $is_released">
      Output the metadata.
    </xsl:when>
    ...
  </xsl:template>


However, for records which were *not* "approved and public", the Equella
XSLT produced the following at the OAI-PMH interface:

  <record>
    <header> ... </header>
    <metadata>
      Either make this node empty or use an empty <oai_qdc:qualifieddc ...  /> element.
    </metadata>
  </record>

which resulted in Alma errors (eg. "Mandatory field 245 is missing").


CONCLUSION

Use a different plan which involves Equella filtering out non-public
records *before* reaching the XSLT processor. Hence the XSLT will be
simpler as it will not filter-out any records.
